## Deep Fake Audio Detection 
the project focuses on tackling the challenges posed by deepfake audio through advanced machine learning techniques. Our primary objective is to develop a robust system capable of distinguishing between authentic and manipulated audio recordings. To achieve this, we employ a two-pronged approach: deepfake audio generation using LSTM-GAN and detection using a CNN classifier. The methodology we adopt follows the CRISP-DM framework, encompassing several key steps. Initially, we define the problem statement and identify the datasets required for training and evaluation. Subsequently, we meticulously analyze and preprocess the audio data to ensure its suitability for model training. The data preparation phase involves splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, followed by conversion into formats compatible with our models.
Our model architecture comprises an LSTM-GAN for generating deepfake audio and a CNN classifier for detection. The LSTM-GAN, consisting of a generator and discriminator, leverages LSTM layers to capture sequential patterns in audio data. Meanwhile, the CNN classifier exploits the ability of CNN models to automatically learn features from spectrograms, facilitating accurate classification.
During the training loop, we meticulously optimize our models using techniques such as shuffling data, updating discriminator and generator weights, and employing appropriate loss functions. The evaluation and results section provides insights into the performance of our models, highlighting areas of success and areas for improvement.
Moving forward, we aim to refine the LSTM-GAN architecture to address computational demands and further enhance the accuracy of our CNN classifier. Additionally, we plan to explore the integration of both models to create a more comprehensive deepfake detection system. Our project's code and documentation are available in this repository, inviting collaboration and contribution from the wider community interested in combating deepfake audio manipulation.

## Marketing Campaigns
In this project it showcase the application of machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and decision tree models, in three distinct banking and finance datasets related to marketing campaigns. It explores datasets focusing on term deposit subscriptions, vehicle insurance cross-selling, and personal loan predictions. Through detailed data exploration, preprocessing, outlier handling, and feature selection, the study delves into model evaluation using metrics such as ROC curves and AUC scores. The results indicate varying performance levels across different datasets and models, with insights drawn from statistical analyses. The findings suggest that the choice of model and dataset significantly impacts predictive accuracy.Overall, the project provides valuable insights into the efficacy of machine learning in enhancing decision-making processes within the banking and finance sector.
